# Housing-Analytics.

### Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing housing data. The dashboard enables users to explore patterns and insights related to housing prices, sizes, location features (e.g., waterfront), and other key attributes. It allows filtering by number of bedrooms, condition, floors, and more â€” offering a dynamic way to answer real estate-related business questions.

### Objectives.
1. Analyze price trends across different housing features.
2. Visualize the impact of variables like view quality, year built, square footage, and waterfront presence on pricing.
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for deeper insight and decision-making in real estate.

### Tools Used.
1. Power BI Desktop
2. Data Transformation: Power Query
3. Data Source: Housing dataset (CSV format)
4. DAX Measures: Used to calculate KPIs such as Average Price, Price per Sqft, and custom aggregations.

### Insights
1. Homes with waterfront views command significantly higher prices per square foot.
2. View ratings have a direct impact on pricing, with "view 4" homes being the most expensive.
3. Most homes fall in the range of 2â€“3 bedrooms, with varied pricing patterns based on condition and size.
4. Prices have fluctuated over the years, with some historical peaks around 1980â€“2000.
5. Larger homes (based on sqft_living) donâ€™t always have higher prices per square foot, indicating diminishing returns.

### Recommendations
1. Investors should consider waterfront properties due to their higher value per square foot.
2. Developers can target features like higher view ratings to boost pricing potential.
3. Policy makers may explore housing trends by year and price for urban planning.
